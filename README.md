This project is the implementation of a web application for the Online Bookstore using Java and Spring Boot. The goal of the project was to create a user-friendly interface for browsing and ordering books. üìö

The project allows users to find, browse, and order books, as well as track the history of their orders. üïµÔ∏è For administrators, I implemented book catalog management, adding and deleting books, updating categories, and tracking orders. üõí

The online bookstore enables users to enjoy their purchases and administrators to manage the store efficiently. üöÄ
